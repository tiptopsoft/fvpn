## Fvpn

Fvpn is a smart vpn software inspired by wireguard. Its aim is allowing all kinds devices, like cell phones,vms,pcs and
so
on to communicate with each other, as if they all reside in the same physical data center or cloud region,
default each pair node will build p2p connection, all your node will compose a private network mesh.

## Benchmark

Zerotier and fvpn compare under the same network environment, fvpn is more stable and faster than zerotier, Both use p2p
connection:
